      <li>Where should you use constants, and where should you use variables? Can they all be constants?</li>
      <p>
				[You should use constants when the value does not change throughout the program, and variables when the value can change. Not all values can be constants.]
			</p>
      <li>How do parentheses affect the arithmetic outcome of an expression?</li>
      <p>
				[Parentheses change the order of operations, ensuring that the expressions within them are evaluated first.]
			</p>
      <li>How do we limit floating-point numbers to a given number of decimals?</li>
      <p>
				[We can use the toFixed() method to limit floating-point numbers to a specific number of decimal places.]
			</p>
      <li>How can we compare two floating-point values to see if they are equal (is 12.199999 the same as 12.2)?</li>
      <p>
				[We can compare two floating-point values by checking if the absolute difference between them is less than a small threshold value (epsilon).]
			</p>
      <li>What do comparison operators return, and how can we check if they are FALSE or TRUE?</li>
      <p>
				[Comparison operators return boolean values (TRUE or FALSE). We can check their values directly in conditional statements or by comparing them to TRUE or FALSE.]
			</p>
      <li>How does the Math.random() function work, and what can it be used for?</li>
      <p>
				[The Math.random() function generates a pseudo-random floating-point number between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive). It can be used for various purposes, such as simulating randomness in games, selecting random items from a list, or generating random test data.]
			</p>
      <li>What is modulus (%), and when do we need this operator in mathematical operations?</li>
      <p>
				[The modulus operator (%) returns the remainder of a division operation. It is useful for determining if a number is even or odd, cycling through a set of values, or constraining values within a certain range.]
