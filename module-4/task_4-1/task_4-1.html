      <li>[Why is object-oriented development so important in programming?]</li>
      <p>[Object-oriented development is important because it allows for better organization, reusability, and maintainability of code through concepts like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.]</p>
      <2i>[In Task 1, we create a static object called "AccountType." Explain what this object is used for and
how this type of object can help us in software development.]</li>
      <p>[The AccountType object is used to define and manage different types of bank accounts. It helps in organizing account types in a structured way, making the code more readable and maintainable. This approach allows for easy extension and modification of account types without affecting other parts of the system.]</p>
      <3i>[Discuss why we use encapsulation in classes. Why do we want to "hide" code within our class?
Explain how we can create "private" and "public" members in a constructor function.]</li>
      <p>[Encapsulation is used to hide the internal state and implementation details of a class from the outside world. This helps in protecting the data and ensuring that it is accessed only through well-defined interfaces. In JavaScript, we can create private members using symbols or closures, and public members are accessible directly from outside the class.]</p>
      <4i>[Explain what happens when we use the "new" command in JavaScript.]</li>
      <p>[When we use the "new" command in JavaScript, it creates a new instance of an object based on a constructor function or class. It initializes the object with the properties and methods defined in the constructor or class, and sets up the prototype chain for inheritance.]</p>
