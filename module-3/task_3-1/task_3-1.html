      <li>Discuss the behavior of part 1, What happens when the wake-up time is not 7 and what happens when it is exactly 7?</li>
      <p>[When the wake up time is not 7, it prints nothing because there is no "else" statement in part 1, and it will just skip the "if" statement. When its exactly 7, it prints out the true statement]</p>
      <li>Same as question #1. How ever the answer should now be different. Discuss the behavior of part 2, What happens when the wake-up time is not 7 and what happens when it is exactly 7?</li>
      <p>[When the wake up time is not 7, the condition will be false, and the program runs "else" to get a different answer]</p>
      <li>Discuss the behavior of part 3, what happens when wake time is less than 7 or greater than 8?</li>
      <p>[if the wake up time is less than 7 or greater than 8, neither the two first conditions are not true. In that case it goes to the final statement that I used "else" statement for. That means that the car becomes the default answer on]</p>
      <li>Discuss the behavior for part 4, what happens if the number is exactly 0, is zero positive or negative?
      </p>[The program says that 0 is neither positive nor negative. the program checks value > 0(positive) and value < 0(negative) 
      the value 0 does not satisfy any of the conditions]</p>
