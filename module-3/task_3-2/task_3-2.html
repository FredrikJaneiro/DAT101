      <1i>[In part 1, is it possible to solve the problem using a single "for" loop?]</li>
      <p>[Yes technically it is possible, because one loop can build on two different strings at the same time(up and down)]</p>
      <2i>[n part 2, can we create what is known as an "infinite" loop within the condition of the "while" loop?
         Describe what would or would not be necessary to achieve this. Provide a thorough explanation of
         your answer.]</li>
      <p>[Yes, we can create an infinite loop, depending on how you write the condition on "while" loop]</p>
      <3i>[Discuss briefly how quickly or slowly a computer might be able to compute this, considering the
          number of guesses and the time it takes. How does the program behave while it is guessing? Can
          the program perform other tasks concurrently?]</li>
      <p>[The computer solves this extremely quickly, usually in a few microseconds. While guessing, the program is busy running a tight loop and cannot perform any other tasks.]</p>
      <4i>[Explain the relationship between rows and columns in nested "for" loops. Can we, for instance,
          change the order, considering rows to be innermost or columns to be innermost, or does this not
          matter?]</li>
      <p>[Yes we can change them, and it will still work. The only difference is the order in which values are printed or generated]</p>
